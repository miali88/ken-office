### Insolvency Details
*   **name_of_introducer**: Mr. John Smith of Smith & Jones Accountants
*   **CONDITION_1**: Prior to this date, neither the firm nor the proposed Liquidators have had any other involvement with the Company or its Director.
*   **write_up_company_history_and_events_leading_to_insolvency**: Aberdeen House Care Limited was incorporated in May 2010 to operate a residential care facility. The company traded profitably for many years, establishing a good reputation in the local community. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in occupancy rates, which did not fully recover. In the last two years, the company has faced unprecedented increases in energy costs and staffing wages, further squeezing profit margins. Despite attempts to secure additional funding and cut costs, the company's cash flow position became untenable, leading to arrears with key creditors, including HMRC and its primary lender. Faced with mounting pressure and the inability to meet its liabilities as they fell due, the directors sought professional advice and concluded that liquidation was the only viable option.
*   **details_of_windup_petition**: No winding-up petition had been presented against the Company prior to the decision to enter voluntary liquidation.
